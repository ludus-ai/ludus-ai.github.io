		<h1>How it Works</h1>
		<p>Ludus AI is an interactive teacher that uses the latest artificial intelligence technology to provide
			personalized education to its users. Here's how it works:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Try the prototype.</li>
			<li>Tell us about yourself and your interests.</li>
			<li>Then just start talking! Your AI teacher will adapt based on your interests and also your grade, if you
				mention it.</li>
			<li>Ask it for anything. Ludus AI is knowledgable on lots of subjects, and is designed specifically for
				students.</li>
			<li>Learn at your own pace. Ask questions. Learn more. Repeat.</li>
			<li>As you learn, the AI will adapt to your specific type of learning.</li>
			<li>Use natural language. If you want to know something, ask it.</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>FAQ</h2>
		<details>
			<summary>What is Ludus, and how does it use AI?</summary>
			<p>Ludus AI is an AI-powered teacher. Human teachers can't personalise teaching for every student, and they
				don't have time to answer questions from everyone. It uses AI by integrating a <b>Large Language
					Model</b> (LLM)
				into a conversation between the student and a simulated teacher.
			</p>
		</details>
		<details>
			<summary>Which AI is being used?</summary>
			<p>We use a model from OpenAI called <b>gpt-3.5-turbo</b>.
			</p>
		</details>
		<details>
			<summary>Why are the AI's responses so similar to ChatGPT's?</summary>
			<p>Ludus is powered by the same technology that ChatGPT uses. They're not the same, but are powered by the
				same neural network/model
				(gpt-3.5-turbo).
			</p>
		</details>
		<details>
			<summary>Can anyone else see my conversations?</summary>
			<p>Nope. Your conversations and account data don't leave your device. </p>
		</details>
		<details>
			<summary>Where are my account details stored?</summary>
			<p>Since this is currently a proof-of-concept, we don't have a backend or any servers or databases to store
				user info.
				Instead, all your data in stored directly on your own device.
			</p>
		</details>
		<details>
			<summary>Does the AI remember my previous conversations?</summary>
			<p>Not yet. Every time you go the main page, you start a new conversation.
			</p>
		</details>
		<details>
			<summary>What is a student report?</summary>
			<p>A student report is a generalised report made by Ludus on your strengths, weaknesses and academic
				personality. It may occasionally be incorrect
				or refer to things you didn't say or do. Sorry about that, we're still working on it. You can see it on your
				dashboard.
			</p>
		</details>
		<details>
			<summary>The AI is generating incorrect information or reported that I said something that I didn't say.
				Why?</summary>
			<p>Sorry. That's called a hallucination or stochastic parroting. That happens when the start of a sentence
				is inherently wrong,
				or just randomly. This is a limitation of most language models right now, even large ones like LLaMA and
				LaMDA.
			</p>
		</details>
		<details>
			<summary>The AI told me that I'm sending messages too fast, or that too many people are talking to it. Why?
			</summary>
			<p>That happens when the AI is being "rate-limited", meaning we can't keep up with the number of messages
				every minute.
				Try again in a bit.
			</p>
		</details>
		<details>
			<summary>It says that an error happened and I can't talk to the AI. Why?</summary>
			<p>That means that an internal error took place. In short, it's a bug. Try reloading the page. Also email us
				at <b>feedback.ludusai@outlook.com</b>.
			</p>
		</details>
		<details>
			<summary>The AI isn't acting very smart. Why?</summary>
			<p>Sorry. Future versions of the app will use a fine-tuned model, so we'll try to make it smarter.
			</p>
		</details>
		<details>
			<summary>Why does your UI look like Discord's?</summary>
			<p>We used a minimalistic dark UI, just like Discord. We didn't copy them.
			</p>
			<p>Alright, fine. We used the colours of dark grey and "blurple", which is now associated with Discord. It's
				not a trademark, so we technically didn't plagiarise.</p>
		</details>
		<details>
			<summary>Do have a mobile app?</summary>
			<p>We have an experimental APK. Email us at <b>feedback.ludusai@outlook.com</b> for it.
			</p>
		</details>
		<details>
			<summary>Your UI looks horrible on my phone! Why?</summary>
			<p>We're still trying to make a responsive/scalable interface. Use it on a PC if possible, please.
			</p>
		</details>
		<details>
			<summary>Where can I send feedback?</summary>
			<p>We'd love feedback. Email us at <b>feedback.ludusai@outlook.com</b>.
